Question 1) One advantage is that it allows you to set a base line for general ticket sales, then if something changes you 
already have the format set, you can just adjust some values. Like with the VIP ticket.

Question 2) In my program I put "Owner's Name Here" as the default, but set up my classes to allow a name to be entered for both
VIP and regualar tickets by adding a constructer that takes a string n as a parameter and set owner = n, allowing me to change the name

Question 3) My first thought is to have a Scanner Console feature that would ask if you would like to purchase a ticket,
have an if/else statement that would then prompt you through the next steps to allow you to purchase a ticket by asking for
a method of payment with another if/else statement; although I would really only be prepared for a credit card at this point
in my coding skill. I could prove if it was a valid card by the total numbers entered but thats about as far as I could take that.

Question 4) Well, like my answer above I would create a payment class that would extend VIP so I could easily access both classes.
The classs would take the cost from the appropriate class, and add taxes and services fees. It would have a getPayment method that
would allow the user to choose from a few payment options (for simplicity purposes it would just be credit card like stated previously)
I would also have a tax feature that would take input from a txt file that contained the sales tax for each state, and a flat rate fee 
for international purchases. I could also have a variety of discount codes, that when prompted for a code if a valid one is entered it 
reduces cost, or gives some extra something to the buyer through a series of if/else statements.
